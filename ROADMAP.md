# This is the rough roadmap and plan.

## A music player and explorer App

    - The last played songs can be implemented as a Stack. This could be fixed to the last 15 songs or something, and can be done as an array.
    - All the songs add to the 'Play Next' can be implemented as a Queue. Since the length of the queue is unknown, it can be done as a linked list.
    - All the various genres + some facts about them can be implemented as a Tree.
